\begin{hcarentry}[updated]{{\tt cab} --- A Maintenance Command of Haskell Cabal Packages}
\report{Kazu Yamamoto}%11/13
\status{open source, actively developed}
\makeheader

{\tt cab} is a MacPorts-like maintenance command of Haskell cabal packages. Some parts of this program are a wrapper to {\tt ghc-pkg} and {\tt cabal}.

If you are always confused due to inconsistency of {\tt ghc-pkg} and {\tt cabal}, or if you want a way to check all outdated packages, or if you want a way to remove outdated packages recursively, this command helps you.

{\tt cab} now supports the sandbox of {\tt cabal} 1.18 and stopped supporting {\tt cabal-dev}. Some new command-line options are added, including {\tt -j} for parallel jobs, {\tt -p} for library profiling and {\tt -e} for executable profiling.
